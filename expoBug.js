This error typically arises when there's a mismatch between the version of Expo CLI installed locally and the project's Expo SDK version specified in `app.json` or `expo.json`.  The CLI might try to use incompatible features or dependencies leading to unexpected behavior during build or start-up.  Another less common cause could be corrupted cache within the Expo CLI itself or conflicting Node.js versions.
