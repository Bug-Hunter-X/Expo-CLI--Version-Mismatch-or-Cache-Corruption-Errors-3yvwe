# Expo CLI: Version Mismatch or Cache Corruption Errors

This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when using Expo CLI. The issue stems from a mismatch between the locally installed Expo CLI version and the project's Expo SDK version, leading to build or runtime errors.  The issue could also be caused by a corrupted cache in the Expo CLI or conflicting Node.js versions. 

## Reproducing the Bug

1. Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed.
2. Clone this repository.
3. Navigate to the project directory.
4. Try running `expo start` or `expo build`. You should encounter an error relating to version incompatibility or cache issues.  The exact error message will vary depending on the nature of the mismatch.

## Solution

The `expoBugSolution.js` file demonstrates how to resolve the issue by addressing the potential root causes:

* **Updating Expo CLI:**  Make sure your `expo-cli` is up-to-date using `npm install -g expo-cli@latest` or `yarn global add expo-cli@latest`.
* **Updating/Matching SDK version:** Check the `expo.json` (or `app.json` for older projects) file to confirm the `sdkVersion` matches a supported version for your current CLI.  Adjust as necessary, referring to Expo's documentation for compatibility.
* **Clearing Cache:** Clearing the Expo CLI cache (`expo cache:clear`) is often effective in resolving unexpected issues.
* **Checking Node.js Version:** Check that your Node.js version is supported by the Expo CLI.  Refer to Expo's documentation for supported versions.  Consider using a Node version manager (nvm) to switch between Node.js versions easily.
* **Reinstall Packages:** Try reinstalling your project's dependencies with `expo install`.
